Lesson 5: Joins and Unions


1. Join the film to the film_actor table.


SELECT * FROM film 
INNER JOIN film_actor 
ON film.film_id = film_actor.film_id




2. Join the actor table to the film_actor table.
 
SELECT * FROM actor 
INNER JOIN film_actor 
ON actor.actor_id = film_actor.actor_id






3. Try to join the actor, film_actor, and film table together (3 joins!)


SELECT *
FROM
    actor
        INNER JOIN
    film_actor
        ON actor.actor_id = film_actor.actor_id
        INNER JOIN 
    film
        ON film_actor.film_id = film.film_id
